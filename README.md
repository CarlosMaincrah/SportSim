# SportSim
FRIO MX
A sports simulator that depends on team's statistics to emulate scores.
The user can create an account, select what sport they want to bet in, see the upcoming matches and select a specific
match they want to bet in. The user will now bet on one team or the other, select how much they will bet and confirm
the transaction. The scores will be now prompted to the user, telling them if they won or lost their bet(s).
