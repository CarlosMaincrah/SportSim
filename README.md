## SportSim
A sports simulator that depends on team's statistics to emulate scores.

The user can create an account(always verifying his/her email account), select what sport they want to bet in, see the upcoming matches and select a specific
match they want to bet in. The user will now bet on one team or the other, they select how much they will bet and confirm
the transaction. The scores will be now prompted to the user, telling them if they won or lost their bet(s).
If they win their bet, depends on how high the reputation of the team was the user will get their bet multiplied by.
The more the reputation the team has, the less you will win and the less the reputation the team has, the more you will win
when your bet wins. (Higher risk = Higher reward)
