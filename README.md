## FRIO MX
A sports betting simulator that depends on teams stats to emulate scores.

It has a fully functional betting system, where the user has to create an account and deposit some money to start betting. The user selects the matches they want to bet in and when the matches end the final score and the result of their bets will be shown to the user. If they won their bet, depends on how high the reputation of the team was the user will get their initial bet multiplied by. The higher the reputation of the team, the less the user will profit from that bet and the lower the reputation of the team, the more the user will profit. (Higher risk = Higher reward)

At first, this was a school project, but then I decided to continue developing it because I liked where this idea was going. Because of the evident behavior similarities with the real matches, this application even makes the user think that these matches between teams are real because of the unpredictability. We have tweaked every single aspect of the application to make it mimic real matches where the team that has better statistics has a bigger chance of winning but, that is not always the case.
