FRIO MX is a sports betting simulator that
depends on teams stats to emulate scores.


You can create an account, deposit money
in your balance, select what sport you want
to bet in, see the upcoming emulated matches
and select a specific match you want to bet in.
You will now bet on one team or the other,
select how much you will bet and confirm the
transaction. The scores will be now prompted to
you, showing you if you won or lost your bet(s).
If you win their bet, depends on how high the
reputation of the team was you will get
your bet multiplied by. The better the
reputation that team has, the less you are
risking, the lower the reputation that team has,
the more you are risking.
(Higher risk = Higher reward)


There are two accounts for superusers and guests,
guest accounts reset everytime you 
start the program and superuser accounts have
unlimited money. These are only intended for
debugging and testing. Use at your own risk.
